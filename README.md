# Youtuber

A CLI tool to download and play audio content from youtube by only searching for audio description. I planned on building this tool for personal use, as its quite annoying to move between tabs and apps to switch songs while working on the terminal. Also, its completely Add-free. It figures out a way to search for the desired content by looking for the description of the song alone. So you don't even need to remmember the song name. And in no time, it just downloads the audio file and start playing.

## How to Use

Use your personal `API key` for the `Youtube API v3` and use it in the config.py file. Otherwise, you can also you th one provided. However its not advisable, since its a personal API key and has use/month limitations.

```shell
$ pip3 install youtube_dl
$ pip3 install pafy
$ pip3 install python-vlc

$ python3 run.py
```
